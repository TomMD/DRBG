0.2.2
* Depend on cryptocipher to provide an AES based DRBG
* We now have a GenCounter instance that uses ctr from crypto-api
0.1.4
* Documentation fixes

0.1.3
* Updated to work with tagged == 0.2.
* Exported newGenAutoReseed{,IO} for those really really long running CRG's.

0.1.2
* Verify the seed length is sufficient when instantiating or reseeding HmacDRBG and HashDRBG
* Move GenSystemRandom out of DRBG (into crypto-api >= 0.3)

New in 0.1.1

* Add HashDRBGWith and HmacDRBGWith
* Allow reseeding of AutoReseed when the second generator to be SystemRandomGen (zero byte reseed of 2nd generator)
* Allow reseeding GenBuffered after an error by tracking the error-inducing generator (and not just the error)
* Fix GenBuffered to buffer properly
